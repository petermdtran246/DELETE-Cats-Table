# DELETE-Cats-Table

## Overview
This repository is a hands-on SQL project designed to help beginners learn and practice the `DELETE` command. It features a `cats` table that stores information about cats, including their IDs, names, breeds, and ages. The project demonstrates how to create a table, insert data, retrieve data, and delete records using various `DELETE` statements. This is an educational example to showcase SQL data manipulation, with a focus on mastering the `DELETE` operation.

## Features
- Create a `cats` table with columns: `cat_id`, `name`, `breed`, and `age`.
- Insert sample data for multiple cats.
- Perform SQL operations to:
  - Retrieve all data from the table using `SELECT *`.
  - Delete specific records (e.g., all 4-year-old cats).
  - Delete records based on matching conditions (e.g., age equals `cat_id`).
  - Delete all records while preserving the table structure.
  - Describe the table structure using `DESC`.
